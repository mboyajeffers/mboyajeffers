### What I Do

I build end-to-end data systems — from infrastructure provisioning to automated reporting. Currently exploring remote opportunities where I can own meaningful chunks of the data stack.

**Focus areas:**
- ETL/ELT pipeline development
- Data quality and validation frameworks
- API integrations (government, financial, market data)
- Star schema dimensional modeling
